# repo (repoman)
A simple tool to manage a your local git repositories.

> This project is still in its early stages and is unusable.

# Installing

I wanted to try publishing my first crate to https://crates.io but noticed that there is already a project called `repo` that is completely unrelated with a very unfriendly owner.
So I renamed my project to `repoman` standing for repo-manager. But feel free to move the binary to your `~/.local/bin` as repo.

You can install it with `cargo install repoman`
