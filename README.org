* Installing
I wanted to try publishing my first crate to https://crates.io but noticed that there is already a project called ~repo~ that is completely unrelated with a very unfriendly owner.
So I renamed my project to ~repom~ standing for repo-manager. But feel free to move the binary to your =~/.local/bin= as repo.
